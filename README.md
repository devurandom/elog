# elog

A simple program to generate a Debian-style changelog for Gentoo packages from
 the Gentoo GitHub repository

## Usage

```
$ lein run [pkg-specs]
```

In case the above command has empty output, you were rate-limited by the GitHub
 API servers.  In this case provide your GitHub username/password to get the
 benefits of higher rate-limits:
```
$ env ELOG_USERNAME=... ELOG_PASSWORD=... lein run [pkg-specs]
```
